# Technology Stack - SeqAlignX

## Core Language
- **Python 3:** The primary language for the algorithm implementation and utility scripts. The project target Python 3.7 or superior.

## Frameworks & Libraries
- **Python Standard Library:** SeqAlignX is designed to be dependency-free, relying solely on the built-in modules of Python (e.g., sys, math, rgparse).

## Data Management
- **File System:** Sequence data is read from local .fasta files.
- **In-Memory Processing:** All alignment calculations and matrix operations are performed in-memory for efficiency on typical biological sequences.

## Development & Tooling
- **Git:** Version control for the codebase.
- **Standard Python Testing:** (Inferred) Usage of unittest or simple assertion-based validation scripts.
