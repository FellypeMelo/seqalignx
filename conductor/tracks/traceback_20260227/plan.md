# Implementation Plan - Implement Traceback and Alignment Reconstruction

## Phase 1: Research and Preparation
- [ ] Task: Analyze current matrix filling logic in main.py
- [ ] Task: Design the traceback function signature and return type
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Research and Preparation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Task: Create tests for alignment reconstruction
    - [ ] Write test cases for identical sequences
    - [ ] Write test cases for sequences with gaps
- [ ] Task: Implement the 	raceback function
- [ ] Task: Integrate 	raceback into the main execution flow
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Display and Formatting
- [ ] Task: Implement clear CLI formatting for the alignment (e.g., side-by-side or stacked)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Display and Formatting' (Protocol in workflow.md)
