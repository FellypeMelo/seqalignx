# Implementation Plan - Implement Traceback and Alignment Reconstruction

## Phase 1: Research and Preparation [checkpoint: d01e359]
- [x] Task: Analyze current matrix filling logic in main.py
- [x] Task: Design the traceback function signature and return type
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Research and Preparation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Implementation [checkpoint: 803eb63]
- [x] Task: Create tests for alignment reconstruction
    - [ ] Write test cases for identical sequences
    - [ ] Write test cases for sequences with gaps
- [x] Task: Implement the traceback function
- [x] Task: Integrate traceback into the main execution flow
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Display and Formatting [checkpoint: a8c3dfd]
- [x] Task: Implement clear CLI formatting for the alignment (e.g., side-by-side or stacked) 5980407
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Display and Formatting' (Protocol in workflow.md)
